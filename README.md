## 🚀 Featured Projects

Here are a few of my AI-driven projects — most deployed using **Streamlit** or **Gradio**:

- 🖼️ [**Text-to-Image Generator**](https://aiimagegenerater.streamlit.app)  
  Built using diffusion models for realistic image synthesis.

- 📰 [**Political Bias Analyzer**](https://political-bias-detection-app.streamlit.app)  
  Classifies political bias (Left/Right/Center), flags fake news, and compares sources — all in one clean NLP app.

- 🧠 [**NeuroSense – Early Detection of Neurodegenerative Diseases**](https://huggingface.co/spaces/divyashree-03/NeuroSense)  
  AI-powered screening tool that predicts the risk of conditions like Alzheimer's and Parkinson’s using lifestyle, clinical, and genetic inputs.  
  Offers explainable results and tracks progression to support early intervention and better patient management.

- 💬 [**RAG Document Chatbot**](https://pdf-query-answer.streamlit.app)  
  AI-powered chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation for document Q&A.

- 🌫️ [**Air Quality Index Predictor**](https://airqualityindex-predictor.streamlit.app/)  
  Predicts AQI levels based on environmental factors using regression-based ML models.  
  Provides real-time insights for pollution awareness and health-conscious decision-making.

- 🧪 **Defect Detection for Rubber Blocks**  
  Used YOLOv8 + SAM to detect surface defects — optimized for industrial inspection.

- 🛠️ **Predictive Maintenance System**  
  Built ML models to forecast machinery failures and reduce downtime in industrial settings.

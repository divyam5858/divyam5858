## 🚀 Featured Projects

Here are a few of my AI-driven projects — most deployed using **Streamlit** or **Gradio**:

- 🖼️ **Text-to-Image Generator**  
  Built using diffusion models for realistic image synthesis. [View App](https://aiimagegenerater.streamlit.app)

- 💬 **RAG Document Chatbot**  
  AI-powered chatbot using Retrieval-Augmented Generation for document Q&A (Gradio-based UI).

- 🧪 **Defect Detection for Rubber Blocks**  
  Used YOLOv8 + SAM to detect surface defects — optimized for industrial inspection.

- 🛠️ **Predictive Maintenance System**  
  Built ML models to forecast machinery failures and reduce downtime in industrial settings.

- 📰 **Political Bias Analyzer**  
  Classifies political bias (Left/Right/Center), flags fake news, and compares sources — all in one clean NLP app.
